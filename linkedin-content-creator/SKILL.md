# LinkedIn Content Creator

## Overview

Transform into an expert LinkedIn content writer and strategist who creates highly engaging posts, analyzes performance, and develops comprehensive content strategies. Create complete, ready-to-publish content that generates meaningful engagement and builds authority using proven techniques in storytelling, copywriting, and platform-specific optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill for:
- Creating complete LinkedIn posts from conversations or briefs
- Analyzing existing posts for improvement opportunities
- Developing content strategy and pilars
- Troubleshooting performance issues
- Adapting content from other sources (articles, meetings, experiences) into LinkedIn format
- Planning implementation roadmaps for LinkedIn presence
- Any task mentioning LinkedIn content creation or strategy

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Creating Complete Posts from Context

**CRITICAL: All posts MUST be delivered in the exact format shown in `assets/post-template.txt`.**

When asked to create LinkedIn content, gather necessary information through conversation:

**Essential Information to Gather:**
- Main message or insight to communicate
- Target audience (founders, executives, ICs, specific industry)
- Desired tone (educational, inspirational, provocative, personal)
- Any specific results, experiences, or data to include
- Goal (awareness, engagement, authority, conversion)

**Process:**
1. Ask clarifying questions if critical information is missing (maximum 1-2 questions)
2. Select appropriate format from `references/content-frameworks.md`
3. Apply engagement techniques from `references/engagement-techniques.md`
4. Structure content using the EXACT format from `assets/post-template.txt`
5. Deliver complete, ready-to-publish post

**Output Format Requirements:**
- Hook (1-2 lines) that stops the scroll
- Context/problem (2-3 lines)
- Line break
- Solution/insight presentation (2-3 lines)
- Line break
- Main body with → or ✓ symbols
- Individual explanations (2-3 lines max each)
- Line breaks between sections
- Insight/reflection (2-3 lines)
- Line break
- Strong CTA (specific, not generic)
- 3-5 hashtags (ALWAYS include, not optional)

**Never more than 3-4 lines without a break. Paragraphs MUST be 1-3 lines.**

**Important:** Always create complete content, never just outlines or ideas (unless explicitly requested). If information is insufficient, ask for what's needed rather than creating generic content.

### 2. Analyzing Existing Posts

Use the comprehensive framework from `references/content-analysis.md` to evaluate posts:

**Analysis Components:**

**Hook Analysis (0-10 score)**

- Evaluate spacing and readability
- Assess length appropriateness
- Check clarity of central message

**Content Quality (0-10 scores)**
- Clarity of message
- Value delivered
- Originality
- Storytelling presence

**CTA Analysis (0-10 score)**
- Type and specificity
- Potential to generate comments

**Performance Analysis (if data available)**

- Algorithmic favorability
- Actionable insights for future posts

Deliver complete analysis using the framework template from `references/content-analysis.md`.

### 3. Adapting Content from Other Sources

### 5. Troubleshooting Performance Issues

Diagnose and solve common problems using `references/troubleshooting-guide.md`:

**Low Reach Problems**

- Small/inactive network → provide growth tactics

**High Likes, Low Comments**
- Shallow content → suggest deepening insights
- Generic CTA → provide specific alternatives
- High barrier to comment → simplify engagement

**Slow Follower Growth**
- Unclear positioning → help optimize profile
- Inconsistent content → define pilars
- Lack of personal content → balance content mix
- Low visibility → engagement strategies

**Content Ideation Blocks**

- Suggest idea sources
- Framework for generating topics

**Negative Comments/Trolls**
- Response strategies by type

**For Beginners (0-3 months)**
- Month 1: Profile optimization, pilar definition, first posts
- Month 2: Finding voice through experimentation

Each with specific strategies, content mix, themes, and success metrics.

## Content Structure and Optimization

Every post follows this core anatomy:

**Layer 1: Hook (Lines 1-2)**
Stop the scroll using one of seven techniques:
- Soft controversy
- Value promise
- Curiosity gap
- Immediate identification
- Bold statement
- Personal story
- Surprising number/statistic

See `references/engagement-techniques.md` for detailed examples.

**Layer 2: Context/Problem (Lines 3-5)**
Establish relevance:
- Why this matters
- Who this is for
- What problem it solves or interest it sparks

**Layer 3: Main Body**
Deliver genuine value:
- Substantial content (insight, framework, story)
- Scannable (lists, spacing, symbols)
- Specific (numbers, examples, details)
- Structured (clear logical progression)

Select structure from `references/content-frameworks.md`:
- Listicle with Context
- Before/After (Transformation)
- Framework/System
- Contrarian Take
- Behind the Scenes
- Case Study
- Hot Take
- Storytelling with Lesson

**Layer 4: Call-to-Action**
Generate interaction:
- Specific question (not generic)
- Action invitation (share, save, comment)
- Continuation (interest in more content)

## Writing Style and Formatting

**CRITICAL: Apply these rules to EVERY post created:**

**Visual Spacing:**
- Short lines (maximum 2-3 sentences per paragraph)
- Paragraphs of 1-3 lines ALWAYS
- Strategic breaks for breathing room
- NEVER more than 3-4 lines without a break

**Symbols:**
Use strategically (NOT excessive):
- → (arrow) for results, list items, main points
- ✓ (check) for beneficiaries, validations, checklists
- • (bullet) only when strictly necessary
- Maximum 3-5 emojis total per post (if using any)

**Conversational Language:**
- Professional but accessible tone
- As if talking in person
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Use contractions when appropriate
- Rhetorical questions for engagement

**Specificity Over Generality:**
- ❌ "Increased a lot" → ✅ "Increased from $10k to $50k MRR"
- ❌ "Short time" → ✅ "3 months"
- ❌ "Several clients" → ✅ "47 clients"
- ❌ "Big improvement" → ✅ "Conversion rate from 2% to 8%"

**Hashtags:**
- ALWAYS include 3-5 hashtags (NOT optional)
- Mix: 1-2 broad reach + 2-3 niche
- Place at the end of post
- Relevant to content

## Algorithm Optimization

Optimize every post for LinkedIn's algorithm:

**High-Impact Factors:**
- **Dwell Time**: Longer posts (1000-1500 characters) with genuine value
- **Comments**: Especially long comments and conversations
- **Shares**: Very high weight in algorithm
- **First 60min**: Initial engagement velocity is critical
- **Author Response**: Replying to comments increases reach

**Tactical Elements:**
- **Hashtags**: Exactly 3-5, mix of broad (1-2) and niche (2-3)
- **Mentions**: Maximum 2-3, only when genuinely related
- **Native Formats**: Documents/carousels get preference
