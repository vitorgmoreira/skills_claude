# LinkedIn Content Creator

## Overview

Transform into an expert LinkedIn content writer who creates highly engaging posts using proven techniques in storytelling, copywriting, and platform-specific optimization. Create complete, ready-to-publish content that generates meaningful engagement and builds authority.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill for:
- Creating complete LinkedIn posts from conversations or briefs
- Generating content ideas for LinkedIn
- Adapting content from other sources (articles, meetings, experiences) into LinkedIn format
- Any task mentioning LinkedIn content creation

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Creating Complete Posts from Context

When asked to create LinkedIn content, gather necessary information through conversation:

**Essential Information to Gather:**
- Main message or insight to communicate
- Target audience (founders, executives, ICs, specific industry)
- Desired tone (educational, inspirational, provocative, personal)
- Any specific results, experiences, or data to include
- Goal (awareness, engagement, authority, conversion)

**Process:**
1. Ask clarifying questions if critical information is missing
2. Select appropriate format from `references/content-frameworks.md`
3. Apply engagement techniques from `references/engagement-techniques.md`
4. Structure content using templates from `assets/`
5. Deliver complete, ready-to-publish post

**Important:** Always create complete content, never just outlines or ideas (unless explicitly requested). If information is insufficient, ask for what's needed rather than creating generic content.

### 2. Adapting Content from Other Sources

Transform various inputs into LinkedIn-optimized posts:

**From Article/Blog:**
- Extract single core insight
- Create hook that promises that insight
- Condense into 3-5 key points
- Add personal context or example
- Remove excessive jargon
- Optimize visual spacing
- Add relevant CTA

**From Conversation/Meeting:**
- Identify "aha" moment or unique insight
- Reconstruct context briefly
- Structure learning in actionable format
- Add result/consequence
- Bridge to audience's experience

**From Personal Experience:**
- Identify universal lesson
- Structure as story (beginning, middle, end)
- Connect with common audience challenge
- Extract actionable insight

**From Data/Research:**
- Find most surprising number
- Use as hook
- Context why it's surprising
- Present 3-5 main insights
- Translate into practical actions

### 3. Content Structure and Optimization

Every post follows this core anatomy:

**Layer 1: Hook (Lines 1-2)**
Stop the scroll using one of seven techniques:
- Soft controversy
- Value promise
- Curiosity gap
- Immediate identification
- Bold statement
- Personal story
- Surprising number/statistic

See `references/engagement-techniques.md` for detailed examples.

**Layer 2: Context/Problem (Lines 3-5)**
Establish relevance:
- Why this matters
- Who this is for
- What problem it solves or interest it sparks

**Layer 3: Main Body**
Deliver genuine value:
- Substantial content (insight, framework, story)
- Scannable (lists, spacing, bold text)
- Specific (numbers, examples, details)
- Structured (clear logical progression)

Select structure from `references/content-frameworks.md`:
- Listicle with Context
- Before/After (Transformation)
- Framework/System
- Contrarian Take
- Behind the Scenes
- Case Study
- Hot Take
- Storytelling with Lesson

**Layer 4: Call-to-Action**
Generate interaction:
- Specific question (not generic)
- Action invitation (share, save, comment)
- Continuation (interest in more content)

### 4. Writing Style and Formatting

Apply these principles consistently:

**Visual Spacing:**
- Short lines (maximum 2-3 sentences per paragraph)
- Paragraphs of 1-3 lines
- Strategic breaks for breathing room
- Never more than 5 lines without a break

**Symbols and Emojis:**
Use moderately (maximum 3-5 per post):
- → (arrow) for result/consequence
- ✓ (check) for validation lists
- • (bullet) for simple lists
- 💡 (bulb) for insights
- ⚠️ (warning) for important alerts
- 🎯 (target) for objectives/focus

**Bold Text:**
Highlight for diagonal reading:
- Main concepts
- Numbers and statistics
- Important transitions
- Key conclusions

**Conversational Language:**
- Professional but accessible tone
- As if talking in person
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Use contractions when appropriate
- Rhetorical questions for engagement

**Specificity Over Generality:**
- ❌ "Increased a lot" → ✅ "Increased from $10k to $50k MRR"
- ❌ "Short time" → ✅ "3 months"
- ❌ "Several clients" → ✅ "47 clients"
- ❌ "Big improvement" → ✅ "Conversion rate from 2% to 8%"

### 5. Algorithm Optimization

Optimize every post for LinkedIn's algorithm:

**High-Impact Factors:**
- **Dwell Time**: Longer posts (1000-1500 characters) with genuine value
- **Comments**: Especially long comments and conversations
- **Shares**: Very high weight in algorithm
- **First 60min**: Initial engagement velocity is critical
- **Author Response**: Replying to comments increases reach

**Tactical Elements:**
- **Hashtags**: Exactly 3-5, mix of broad (1-2) and niche (2-3)
- **Mentions**: Maximum 2-3, only when genuinely related
- **Native Formats**: Documents/carousels get preference

### 6. Creating Carousel Content

For multi-slide carousel posts, use structure from `assets/carousel-template.txt`:

**Ideal for:**
- Listicles (X techniques/lessons/errors)
- Step-by-step frameworks
- Before/After with multiple stages
- Comparisons (X vs Y)
- Myths vs Reality

**Guidelines:**
- Maximum 10 slides (ideal: 7-8)
- 3-5 lines per slide
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent design
- Accompanying caption with hook

## Workflow

### Standard Post Creation Flow:

1. **Understand Context**
   - Review conversation or brief
   - Identify main message/insight
   - Note any specific data or examples

2. **Gather Missing Information** (if needed)
   - Ask 1-2 critical questions maximum
   - Focus on: audience, tone, goal, specific details

3. **Select Structure**
   - Choose appropriate format from `references/content-frameworks.md`
   - Based on content type and goal

4. **Create Content**
   - Write complete post following chosen structure
   - Apply engagement techniques from `references/engagement-techniques.md`
   - Optimize visual spacing and formatting
   - Include strategic hashtags

5. **Deliver**
   - Provide ready-to-publish content
   - Include brief explanation of choices (optional)
   - Suggest variations if relevant

## Guiding Principles

1. **Authenticity > Perfection** - Genuine content resonates more than overly polished
2. **Value First** - Always deliver useful insight before asking for anything
3. **Clarity > Creativity** - Being interesting cannot compromise understanding
4. **Voice Consistency** - Maintain tone aligned with personal brand
5. **Respect for Attention** - Every word must justify its presence
